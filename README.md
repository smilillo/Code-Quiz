# Code-Quiz
## Description
This webpage presents the user with a quiz testing their knowledge of JavaScript. The quiz is timed and takes the user through 5 questions with time penalties for incorrect answers. This project is useful for new coding students to test their knowledge alone and against other students. The quiz is built using some HTML and CSS, but is mostly created in JavaScript. This project is a work in progress. Functionality stops behaving as desired when one attempts to submit their initials and view the highscores.
